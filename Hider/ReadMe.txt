This little utility hides all the unnecessary window and displays them in the taskbar
Just press Ctrl+Alt+Space in the window which is to be hidden, it hides them and makes
your desktop free of clumsy windows. All you have to do is to double click the taskbar
icon to show the windows.
And it can even hide itself!!
